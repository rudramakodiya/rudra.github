  <h1>Books I Read</h1>

  <p>
    I have read many books from different sources such as my school library,
    my friends, and personal recommendations.
  </p>

  <p>
    My favourite book series is <b>The Magic Tree House</b>.
    This series is about two children named <b>Jack and Annie</b>.
    One day, they discover a mysterious treehouse in the woods.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the treehouse, they find books that take them to different places
    in time. Whenever they wish to go somewhere, the treehouse spins faster
    and faster and suddenly stops at the place described in the book.
  </p>

  <p>
    My favourite book from this series is
    <b>The Dragon of the Red Dawn</b>.
