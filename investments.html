  <h1>Future Investments</h1>

  <p>
    In the future, I plan to invest in the <b>stock market</b>.
    One example is investing in technology companies such as Apple.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would also invest in <b>gold, silver, and diamonds</b>,
    as they are considered safer investment options.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: Physical assets must be stored safely as they can be stolen.
