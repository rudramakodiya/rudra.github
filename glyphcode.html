  <h1>GlyphCode</h1>

  <p>
    I invented a new writing style known as <b>GlyphCode</b>.
    GlyphCode is a self-created symbolic writing system.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this writing style, letters and words of the English language
    are represented using unique symbols.
    It reflects creativity, originality, and structured thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    GlyphCode uses symbols such as <b>@ | ₹ ¶ ∆</b> and many more.
    I have completed symbols for all alphabets from A to Z.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may look confusing to others, but it is meaningful and systematic.
